# House-Price-Prediction
This is my first project on machine learning using linear regression model in Python, I have done some exploratory Data Analysis and used some of the commonly used libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. For the machine learning part, I used scikit learn for using the linear regression model.
