# Linear-Regression
Note:- This project is part of an Udemy Course [course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).
Here, we are provided with a sample dataset containing customer information for the campany's app and website, which is also provided in the course. We perform some exploratory Data Analysis and have some insights into the data provided, then we try to predict how the company's app or website will perform in future in terms of comapring the time spent by the customers on either of them.

##Dependencies  
*numpy  
*pandas  
*matplotlib

You can just run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) if you don't already have it.

# Usage 
The code is being written in Jupyter Notebook, I personally used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distributed jupyter notebook to write the code. I recommend using the same, to get the scatter plot and line of best fit without facing any memory or other issues.
